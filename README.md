[GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.

It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.

This is a Docker image of GROMACS, which - if used with [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) - can provide hardware acceleration using NVIDIA GPUs.

## Tags

Docker image tags correspond to the official [Gromacs releases](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/). Note that the tags without a minor version number (e.g. `2019`) are not updated for new minor versions (e.g. `2019.1`), as `2019` and `2019.1` are distinct GROMACS versions (`2019` ~= `2019.0`).

Feel free to raise a [pull request](https://github.com/bioexcel/gromacs-docker/pulls) to add a new release by updating according to the instructions below.


## Running

Docker requires [binding](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) of any directory that the container should have access to. The flag `-it` is also recommended for any interactive steps. All GROMACS commands are executed as `gmx MODULE`,  each module provides their own help:

    docker run gromacs/gromacs gmx help commands
    docker run gromacs/gromacs gmx help pdb2gmx 

The below highlights this using an example of using `pdb2gmx` from the tutorial [KALP15 in DPPC](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/membrane_protein/01_pdb2gmx.html):

    mkdir $HOME/data ; cd $HOME/data
    wget http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/membrane_protein/Files/KALP-15_princ.pdb
    docker run -v $HOME/data:/data -w /data -it gromacs/gromacs gmx pdb2gmx -f KALP-15_princ.pdb -o KALP-15_processed.gro -ignh -ter -water spc


It is beyond the scope of this README file to document GROMACS usage. For further information see:

* http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/


### Hardware-acceleration

The command `gmx` in this container image will attempt to [detect](https://github.com/bioexcel/gromacs-docker/blob/dev/gmx-chooser) your CPU's AVX/SSE flags to use the corresponding optimized `gmx` binary.

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, some GROMACS modules (in particular `mdrun`) can benefit hugely from hardware acceleration by using [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) which takes care of mapping the GPU device files. Simply replace `docker` above with `nvidia-docker` in the commands above.

### Other distributions

A pre-compiled GROMACS distribution using OpenCL acceleration is available from [BioConda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/gromacs).

The corresponding [BioContainers](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/gromacs?tab=tags) Docker image can be used instead of this image, but that will not be able to provide GPU acceleration without additional binding of OpenCL folders.

Debian/Ubuntu [include GROMACS](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gromacs) with variants for different hardware, but these may not be the latest version.

In many cases compiling GROMACS from [source code](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/download) for your particular OS/hardware will provide additional performance gains. See the [installation guide](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/install-guide/index.html) for details.

### Building the containers

All of the containers are built by GitHub actions.  This is done in a three part process.

 - Build a container with optimised FFTW in.
 - Build containers with GROMACS optimised for each SIMD type and/or GROMACS version
 - Build a container for each GROMACS version that includes all containers built\
 in the previous step

This will require you to have an account on Dockerhub, and to have setup a PAT that you have then told Github about.  The main part that then needs changing is the dockerhub repository in the workflow file: `.github/workflow/main.yml`

### Bumping the version of GROMACS, cuda or SIMD types

To change the version of GROMACS or CUDA, you just need to change the variables in the workflow file: `.github/workflow/main.yml`

To change the SIMD types requires you to update the build matrix in workflow file and add them to the `additional_simd_types` in the workflow file.

### CI Workflow and how the container is built

- `build-all-dockerfiles.sh` calls `build-dockerfiles.py` once for each simd-type specified in the array 'simd_types'.
- `build-dockerfiles.py` generates a dockerfile based on several variables, such as GROMACS version, CUDA version and SIMD type. This is stored in a directory named `gmx-<gromacs_version>-cuda-<cuda_version>-<simd_type>`.
- `fftw/Dockerfile` will build an optimised version of lib-fftw in a container.
- `Dockerfile` will build the single combined container
